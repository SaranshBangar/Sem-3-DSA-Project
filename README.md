<p id="description">I was tasked to find how Data Structures are implemented in my college campus, and thus I found out how Arrays are an integral part of our canteen!</p>

<h2>Operations in Project</h2>

* Creation
* Deletion
* Searching
* Traversal

<h2>Advantages of Arrays</h2>

1. **Efficient Access:** Arrays provide constant-time access to elements using their indices, ensuring efficient data retrieval and update.

2. **Sequential Storage:** Elements in an array are stored sequentially in memory, improving cache locality and access speed.

3. **Predictable Memory Allocation:** Array sizes are fixed at creation, enabling predictable memory management and efficient memory usage.

4. **Simplified Data Structure:** Arrays offer a simple and intuitive way to store collections of data, making them easy to work with.

5. **Mathematical Operations:** Arrays are well-suited for mathematical and statistical operations, as they support element-wise calculations.

6. **Fixed Size:** For some use cases, having a fixed-size array can be an advantage, ensuring consistent memory usage and performance characteristics.


<h2>Disadvantages of Arrays</h2>

1. **Fixed Size:** The size of an array is static, making it less suitable for scenarios with dynamic or unknown data sizes.

2. **Wasteful Memory:** Overallocating an array may lead to wasted memory when not all allocated space is used.

3. **Inefficient Insertions and Deletions:** Inserting or deleting elements within an array can be inefficient, potentially requiring the shifting of other elements.

4. **Homogeneous Data Type:** Arrays typically store elements of the same data type, limiting their flexibility for heterogeneous data.

5. **No Built-in Dynamic Sizing:** Unlike dynamic data structures like lists or dynamic arrays, arrays lack built-in resizing capabilities.

6. **Limited Operations:** Arrays offer a limited set of functionality compared to more complex data structures, such as linked lists or trees, which support a wider range of operations.

7. **Index Boundaries:** Accessing or modifying elements beyond the array's bounds can result in memory access violations or errors.
